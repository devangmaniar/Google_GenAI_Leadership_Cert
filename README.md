## Core Concepts of Artificial Intelligence

### What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the broader field of Computer Science focused on **creating machines/computers that can think, learn, and act like humans**.  
- AI includes tasks such as **learning, problem-solving, understanding language, and decision making**.  
- AI is essentially **mimicking human cognition**.  

---

### What is Machine Learning (ML)?
- **Machine Learning (ML)** is a **subset of AI** where machines/computers **learn from data** to perform specific tasks.  
- ML is **teaching machines to learn from experience**, similar to how humans learn.  

**Example of ML**:  
- Show a machine thousands of pictures of cats and dogs with labels.  
- It learns patterns.  
- Later, when shown a new picture, it can predict whether it’s a cat or dog—even if it’s never seen that exact image before.  

---

### What is Deep Learning (DL)?
- **Deep Learning** is a **subset of ML** that uses **neural networks with many layers** to solve complex problems (images, audio, text, or large-scale data).  
- DL tries to **mimic the human brain** (neurons + layers) to learn in a much deeper way.  
- DL is often called **ML on steroids**.  

**Examples**:  
- Face Recognition  
- Voice Assistants  
- Self-Driving Cars  
- Language Translation (e.g., Google Translate)  

---

### What is Generative AI (GenAI)?
- **GenAI** is a **subset of Deep Learning**.  
- GenAI is focused on **creating new content** (text, images, audio, code, etc.).  
- GenAI = teaching machines to be **creative**, generating something new that looks or sounds real.  

---

### What are Foundational Models?
- **Foundational Models** are a **subset of GenAI**.  
- Large-scale AI models (e.g., Gemini) pre-trained on **massive, diverse datasets**.  
- Enable broad understanding + ability to perform **a wide variety of tasks**.  
- They are the **brains of AI systems/agents**.  

**Examples**:  
- **OpenAI**: GPT-4, DALL-E, Sora  
- **Google**: Gemini, PaLM, Imagen  
- **Meta**: LLaMA  

---

### What are Large Language Models (LLM)?
- **LLMs** are a **subset of Foundational Models**.  
- Specifically trained on **text data** to **understand + generate human language** (text, speech, or code).  
- LLMs have read billions of words → can generate responses, answer questions, write, translate, summarize, etc.  
- **All LLMs are Foundational Models, but not all Foundational Models are LLMs**.  

**Examples**:  
- GPT-4 (OpenAI)  
- Gemini, PaLM (Google)  
- LLaMA (Meta)  
- Titan (Amazon)  

---

### What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
- **NLP** is a sub-field of AI.  
- Gives machines the ability to **read, understand, and derive meaning from human language**.  
- Example: analyzing reviews for **topics and sentiment**.  

---

### Difference between TRADITIONAL AI and GENERATIVE AI
- **Traditional AI** → focuses on **prediction + classification** based on existing data.  
- **Generative AI** → focuses on **creating new content** based on learned patterns.  

---

## Machine Learning Approaches

### 1. Supervised ML Approach
- Trains models on **labeled data** to predict outputs for new inputs.  
- Learns from examples with correct answers.  

**Examples**:  
- **Use Case 1**: Training a model with fruit photos + labels (apples, bananas, oranges). Later, the model can identify unlabeled fruits.  
- **Use Case 2**: Training a model with house data (size, #bedrooms, location, price). Later, it predicts prices for new houses.  

---

### 2. Unsupervised ML Approach
- Trains models on **unlabeled data** to find **patterns, structures, or groupings**.  
- **No predefined labels/outcomes**.  
- Many foundational models use this approach.  

**Examples**:  
- **Use Case 1**: Grouping fruit photos by shapes/colors, without knowing their names.  
- **Use Case 2**: At a party, grouping people by clothing style without knowing their names or jobs.  

---

### 3. Reinforcement ML Approach
- Model learns by **maximizing rewards** and **minimizing penalties** via interaction + human feedback.  
- **Good behavior = reward**  
- **Bad behavior = penalty**  

**Examples**:  
- Training a pet  
- Self-driving cars  
- Playing chess/Pac-Man  
- Robot vacuum cleaners  
- Child learning to get candy from a vending machine
