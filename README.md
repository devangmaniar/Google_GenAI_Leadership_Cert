## Core Concepts of Artificial Intelligence

### What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
- AI is the BROADER field of computer science focused on creating machines or computers that can think, learn, and ACT LIKE HUMANS.
- AI mimics human cognition and typically requires human intelligence.

### What is Machine Learning (ML)?
- ML is a SUBSET of AI where machines learn from data to perform specific tasks.
- Example: Teaching a machine to distinguish cats and dogs from images.

### What is Deep Learning (DL)?
- DL is a SUBSET of ML using NEURAL NETWORKS with many layers to model complex problems.
- Examples: Face Recognition, Voice Assistants, Self-Driving Cars, Language Translation.

### What is Generative AI (GenAI)?
- GenAI is a SUBSET of DL that helps users CREATE or GENERATE new content (text, images, audio, code).

### What are Foundational Models?
- LARGE-SCALE AI Models pre-trained on massive and diverse datasets.
- Example: GPT-4, DALL-E, Gemini, PaLM, LLaMA.

### What are Large Language Models (LLM)?
- LLMs are SUBSET of Foundational Models trained on TEXT DATA to understand and generate human language.
- Example: GPT-4, Gemini, PaLM, LLaMA.

### What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
- NLP enables machines to read, understand, and derive meaning from human languages.

### Difference between Traditional AI and Generative AI
- Traditional AI: Focuses on prediction/classification.
- Generative AI: Focuses on creating new content.

## Machine Learning Approaches

1. **Supervised ML Approach**: Trains models on LABELED DATA.
   - Example: Predicting fruit type from labeled images.

2. **Unsupervised ML Approach**: Trains models on UNLABELED DATA to find patterns.
   - Example: Clustering fruit types without labels.

3. **Reinforcement ML Approach**: Learns through REWARDS and PENALTIES.
   - Example: Training a pet or a self-driving car.

## Machine Learning Lifecycle

### Key Stages
1. **Data Ingestion & Preparation**: Gather and clean data.
2. **Model Training**: Train ML model with chosen algorithm.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assess performance.
4. **Model Deployment**: Deploy into production.
5. **Model Management/Monitoring**: Monitor and retrain if necessary.

## GenAI: 4-Ways to Use GenAI
1. **Create**: Generate new content (text, images, audio, video).
2. **Summarize**: Condense information.
3. **Discover**: Find patterns or insights.
4. **Automate**: Automate tasks previously done manually.

## Key Roles for GenAI
1. Business Leaders: Understand use cases and drive adoption.
2. Developers: Build and deploy AI agents and models.
3. AI Practitioners: Customize, deploy, optimize models responsibly.

## 5-Core Layers of GenAI
1. **Infrastructure Layer**: GPUs, TPUs, storage, computing power.
2. **Model Layer**: Pre-trained models (LLMs, multimodal).
3. **Agent Layer**: Orchestrates models, tools, memory, reasoning.
4. **Platform Layer**: Tools & services to deploy and manage GenAI models.
5. **Application Layer**: End-users interact through apps (Gmail, Docs, Sheets).

## Data
- Data is information used to train ML models.
- Quality data is crucial for performance.
- Characteristics of quality data: Accuracy, Completeness, Representative, Consistency, Relevance, Cost.

### Structured vs Unstructured Data
- **Structured**: Organized in tables/spreadsheets.
- **Unstructured**: Messy data like emails, PDFs, audio, video.

### Labeled vs Unlabeled Data
- **Labeled**: Tagged with meaningful outputs.
- **Unlabeled**: Raw data; used in foundational models.

## AI Models: Types of AI Models

### GenAI Models
- Generate new content from large datasets.
- Accessible through Google Vertex AI, AI Studio, Gemini.

### Foundational Models
- Large-scale, pre-trained, adaptable for multiple tasks.
- Examples: Google Gemini, OpenAI GPT.

### Large Language Models (LLM)
- Pre-trained on massive datasets for text understanding and generation.

### Multimodal Foundational Models
- Process multiple input types simultaneously (text, image, audio, video).

### Diffusion Models
- Generate high-quality images from text descriptions.

### Machine Learning Models
- Trained on task-specific datasets; examples: Linear Regression, Decision Tree.

## AI Models: Choosing the Right Model
- Consider **Modality**, **Context Window**, **Performance**, **Availability and Reliability**.

## Foundational Models Deep Dive
- **Key Features**: Diverse data, flexible, adaptable.
- **Limitations**: Data dependency, knowledge cutoff, bias, fairness, hallucinations, edge cases.
- **Differences**:
  - LLM vs Foundational Models: LLMs focus on language; Foundational Models are general-purpose.
  - Foundational vs Traditional Models: Foundational are pre-trained on massive datasets; traditional are task-specific.

### 4 Key Types of Foundational Models
1. Gemini: Multimodal, large-scale AI model.
2. Gemma: Lightweight, open-source model.
3. Imagen: Text-to-image generation.
4. VEO: Text-to-video generation.
