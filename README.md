# 1. FUNDAMENTALS of AI

## 1.1 What is Artificial Intelligence
Artificial Intelligence (AI) is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems.

## 1.2 What is Machine Learning
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI that allows systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed.

## 1.3 What is Deep Learning (DL)
Deep Learning is a subset of ML that uses neural networks with multiple layers to learn complex patterns from data.

## 1.4 What is Generative AI (GenAI)
GenAI refers to AI models that can generate new content such as text, images, music, or code. Examples include ChatGPT and DALL·E.

## 1.5 What are Foundational Models
Foundational models are large-scale models trained on broad data that can be adapted to a wide range of downstream tasks.

## 1.6 What are Large Language Models
LLMs are types of foundational models that are trained on vast amounts of text and are capable of understanding and generating human-like language.

## 1.7 What is Gemini App
Gemini is Google’s family of multimodal AI models and tools that power GenAI applications in Google Cloud, Colab, and Workspace.
