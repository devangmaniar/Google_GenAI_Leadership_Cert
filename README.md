# What is AI? — Simple Explanation

This repository publishes a concise, plain-language explanation of AI, ML, DL, GenAI, Foundational Models, LLMs, and NLP.

## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the BROADER field of Computer Science focused on CREATING or BUILDING MACHINES or COMPUTERS that can think, learn, and ACT LIKE HUMANS such as learning, problem-solving, understanding language and decision making.  
- AI is **BUILDING MACHINES** that typically require HUMAN INTELLIGENCE.  
- AI is basically **MIMICKING HUMAN COGNITION**.

## What is Machine Learning (ML)?
- **Machine Learning (ML)** is a **SUBSET** of Artificial Intelligence where machines or computers **LEARN FROM DATA** to perform SPECIFIC TASKS.  
- ML is **TEACHING Machines to learn from experience**, like how humans learn.  
- **Example**: If you show a machine thousands of pictures of cats and dogs and tell it which is which, it will learn to recognize patterns. Later, it can predict whether a new picture is a cat or a dog.

## What is Deep Learning (DL)?
- Deep Learning is a **SUBSET of Machine Learning (ML)** that uses **NEURAL NETWORKS** with many layers to model and solve complex problems (images, audio, text, large-scale data).
- It tries to **MIMIC how HUMAN BRAINS work** (neurons and layers) to learn from data in a deeper, layered way.
- Deep Learning is **Machine Learning on STEROIDS**.
- **Examples**:
  - Face Recognition
  - Voice Assistants
  - Self-Driving Cars
  - Language Translation (e.g., Google Translate)

## What is Generative AI (GenAI)?
- **GenAI** is a **SUBSET of Deep Learning**.
- GenAI focuses on helping users **CREATE or GENERATE NEW CONTENT** (text, images, audio, code, etc.).
- GenAI teaches machines to be creative — generate new content that did not exist before but looks or sounds real.

## What are Foundational Models?
- **Foundational Models** are a **SUBSET of GenAI**.
- They are **LARGE-SCALE, PRE-TRAINED MODELS** (e.g., Gemini) trained on massive, diverse datasets to develop a broad understanding and perform many tasks.
- They are the **BRAINS** of AI systems and agents.
- **Examples**:
  - GPT-4, DALL·E, Sora (OpenAI)
  - Gemini, PaLM, Imagen (Google)
  - LLaMA (Meta / Facebook)

## What are Large Language Models (LLM)?
- **LLMs** are a **SUBSET of Foundational Models**, trained mainly on **TEXT**.
- They understand and **GENERATE HUMAN LANGUAGE** (text, speech, code).
- **Examples**:
  - GPT-4 (OpenAI)
  - Gemini, PaLM (Google)
  - LLaMA (Meta)
  - Titan (Amazon)

## What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?
- **NLP** is the sub-field of AI that gives machines the ability to **read, understand, and derive meaning** from human language. Classic tasks include summarization, translation, sentiment analysis, etc.

## Difference between Traditional AI and Generative AI
- **Traditional AI**: Focuses on **Prediction and Classification** based on existing data.
- **Generative AI**: Focuses on **Creating new content** based on learned patterns.
