## Modeling Technique: Prompt Engineering

### What is PROMPT ENGINEERING (Prompting)?
- Providing models with **clear, specific instructions (prompts)** for more accurate outputs.  
- Guides foundational models to generate desired outputs.  
- Optimizes prompts to **maximize output quality**.

**Example:**
- Generic Input: `"What is our return policy for electronics purchased during the holiday season?"`  
- Prompt Engineering Input: `"Electronics purchased between Nov 1 and Dec 31 can be returned within 60 days with the original receipt."`

## Modeling Technique: Fine Tuning

### What is FINE TUNING?
- Train the model on **domain-specific datasets** for better performance.  
- Works with **smaller task-specific datasets**.

**Example:**
- Task: Review NDAs or contracts.  
- Dataset: Thousands of internal legal documents.  
- Result: Model understands organizational contract standards, highlights risks, and suggests changes.

## Modeling Technique: HITL (Human-in-the-Loop)

### What is HITL?
- Humans **actively guide, correct, and validate** model outputs.  
- Used when AI alone is **not reliable**.  
- Essential in regulated, sensitive, or customer-facing environments.

**Example:**  
- Task: Summarize medical/legal documents.  
- Human expert reviews and corrects summaries.

## Prompt Engineering: Deep Dive

### What are PROMPTS?
- Input text given to AI to generate desired output.  
- Can be a **question, command, or description**.

### What are PROMPT ENGINEERS?
- Professionals who **design, test, and refine prompts**.  
- Optimize AI model performance and collaborate with teams.

### What is REUSING PROMPTS?
- Save prompts as **templates** for repeated use.  
- Useful in **prompt chaining**, saving conversation threads for future use.

---

### Types of Prompting Techniques

#### 1. ZERO SHOT Prompting
- Task completed **without prior examples**.  
- Model relies on **pretrained intelligence**.  

**Example:**  
- Task: "Write a formal email apologizing for a late delivery."  
- Model generates response using pretrained knowledge.

#### 2. ONE SHOT Prompting
- Provide **one example** as guidance.  

**Example:**  
- Task: Translate "It is a hot day" to French.  
- Example: `"English: Hello -> French: Bonjour"`  
- Model Output: `"C’est une journée chaude"`

#### 3. FEW SHOT Prompting
- Provide **multiple examples** for guidance.  

**Example:**  
- Input: Multiple movie reviews labeled Positive/Negative/Neutral  
- Model learns patterns and outputs sentiment for a new review.

#### 4. ReACT Prompting
- Combines **Reasoning + Action + Observation** for step-by-step problem-solving.  
- Uses external tools (Search, APIs, Calculators).  

**Example:**  
- Task: Compare population of NYC and Tokyo.  
- ReACT steps:
  1. Thought → Identify info needed.  
  2. Action → Search for population.  
  3. Observation → Collect numbers.  
  4. Repeat until final answer.

#### 5. Chain of Thought (CoT)
- Guides AI to **reason step-by-step**.  
- No external actions, focuses on **logic and intermediate reasoning**.

#### 6. Prompt Chaining
- Breaks complex tasks into **smaller prompts**.  
- Output from one prompt informs the next.  

**Example:**  
- Prompt 1: Summarize a 10-page document.  
- Prompt 2: Generate executive summary.  
- Prompt 3: Create slide bullet points from summary.

#### 7. ROLE PROMPTING
- Assigns a **persona** to influence model style, tone, and focus.  

**Examples:**  
- Teacher → Explain math simply.  
- Doctor → Give medical advice.  
- Software Engineer → Write Python code.  
- Legal Advisor → Summarize legal risks.

#### 8. PROMPT TUNING
- **Soft prompt embeddings** added to input to guide a frozen pre-trained model.  
- Efficient fine-tuning for specific tasks without changing model weights.

### Difference between ReACT and CoT
| Technique | ReACT | CoT |
|-----------|-------|-----|
| Action | Yes, uses tools/APIs | No |
| Reasoning | Step-by-step + actions | Step-by-step reasoning only |
| Example | Population of Japan: uses search | Explains reasoning using logic/math |

- Allow users to **customize and fine-tune** GenAI results.

---

### 1. TOKEN COUNT
- Controls **how long the responses are** (number of tokens).  
- Lower value → shorter sentences  
- Higher value → longer sentences

### 2. TEMPERATURE
- Controls **randomness and creativity**.  
- Lower value → more focused, reliable, factual  
- Higher value → more creative, diverse, surprising

### 3. TOP-P (Nucleus)
- Limits **token selection based on probability**.  
- Lower Top P (1.0) → considers all tokens, more factual, focused  
- Higher Top P (0.9) → includes less probable words, more diverse

### 4. SAFETY SETTINGS
- Blocks **harmful or inappropriate content**.  
- Lower safety → riskier, less filtered  
- Higher safety → stricter, safer output

### 5. TOP-K
- Controls **most probable tokens**.  
- K = number of tokens chosen (e.g., K=5 picks top 5 likely words)  
- Lower K → very predictable  
- Higher K → more variety, creative output

### 6. OUTPUT LENGTH
- Controls **maximum tokens or words** the model can generate.  
- Lower value → shorter output  
- Higher value → longer output
