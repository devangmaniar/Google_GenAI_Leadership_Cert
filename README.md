## What is Artificial Intelligence (AI)?
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the BROADER field of Computer Science focused on CREATING or BUILDING MACHINES or COMPUTERS that can think, learn, and ACT LIKE HUMANS such as learning, problem-solving, understanding language and decision making.  
- AI is **BUILDING MACHINES** that typically require HUMAN INTELLIGENCE.  
- AI is basically **MIMICKING HUMAN COGNITION**.

## What is Machine Learning (ML)?
- **Machine Learning (ML)** is a **SUBSET** of Artificial Intelligence where machines or computers **LEARN FROM DATA** to perform SPECIFIC TASKS.  
- ML is **TEACHING Machines to learn from experience**, like how humans learn.  
- **Example**: If you show a machine thousands of pictures of cats and dogs and tell it which is which, it will learn to recognize patterns. Later, it can predict whether a new picture is a cat or a dog.

## What is Deep Learning (DL)?
- Deep Learning is a **SUBSET of Machine Learning (ML)** that uses **NEURAL NETWORKS** with many layers to model and solve complex problems (images, audio, text, large-scale data).
- It tries to **MIMIC how HUMAN BRAINS work** (neurons and layers) to learn from data in a deeper, layered way.
- Deep Learning is **Machine Learning on STEROIDS**.
- **Examples**:
  - Face Recognition
  - Voice Assistants
  - Self-Driving Cars
  - Language Translation (e.g., Google Translate)

## What is Generative AI (GenAI)?
- **GenAI** is a **SUBSET of Deep Learning**.
- GenAI focuses on helping users **CREATE or GENERATE NEW CONTENT** (text, images, audio, code, etc.).
- GenAI teaches machines to be creative — generate new content that did not exist before but looks or sounds real.

## What are Foundational Models?
- **Foundational Models** are a **SUBSET of GenAI**.
- They are **LARGE-SCALE, PRE-TRAINED MODELS** (e.g., Gemini) trained on massive, diverse datasets to develop a broad understanding and perform many tasks.
- They are the **BRAINS** of AI systems and agents.
- **Examples**:
  - GPT-4, DALL·E, Sora (OpenAI)
  - Gemini, PaLM, Imagen (Google)
  - LLaMA (Meta / Facebook)

## What are Large Language Models (LLM)?
- **LLMs** are a **SUBSET of Foundational Models**, trained mainly on **TEXT**.
- They understand and **GENERATE HUMAN LANGUAGE** (text, speech, code).
- **Examples**:
  - GPT-4 (OpenAI)
  - Gemini, PaLM (Google)
  - LLaMA (Meta)
  - Titan (Amazon)

## What is Natural Language Processing (NLP)?

## Difference between Traditional AI and Generative AI
- **Traditional AI**: Focuses on **Prediction and Classification** based on existing data.
- **Generative AI**: Focuses on **Creating new content** based on learned patterns.

# Machine Learning Approaches

This repository explains the three main approaches to Machine Learning: Supervised, Unsupervised, and Reinforcement.

---

## 1. Supervised ML Approach
- Supervised Learning trains models on **labeled data** to predict outputs for new inputs.  
- It uses examples with correct answers so the model learns how to make predictions on new, similar data.  

**Examples:**
- Train a model on labeled fruit photos (apples, bananas, oranges). Once trained, the model can guess the fruit in a new photo.  
- Train a model on house prices with labeled data (size, bedrooms, location, sale price). Once trained, the model can predict prices of new houses.

---

## 2. Unsupervised ML Approach
- Unsupervised Learning trains models on **unlabeled data** to find patterns, structures, or natural groupings without knowing the correct output.  
- It has **no predefined labels or outcomes**.  
- Foundational Models often use unsupervised learning to find patterns and relationships on their own.  

**Examples:**
- Train a model on fruit photos without labels. It groups them by shape, color, or size, but doesn’t know they’re apples or bananas.  
- At a party with strangers, you group people by clothing (suits, gym wear, etc.) without knowing their names or jobs.

---

## 3. Reinforcement ML Approach
- Reinforcement Learning trains models through **interaction and feedback**, learning to maximize rewards and minimize penalties.  
- **Good behavior = reward**; **Bad behavior = penalty**.  

**Examples:**
- Training a pet with rewards/punishments  
- Self-driving cars  
- Playing chess or Pac-Man  
- Robot vacuum cleaners  
- A child learning how to get candy from a vending machine  

# GenAI: 4-Ways to use GenAI

## 1. Create 
- Create or Generate New Content  
- **Examples of Create:** generate text responses, draft emails to clients, create presentations, create images, videos and audio  

## 2. Summarize 
- Condense large amounts of information into concise summaries  
- **Examples of Summarize:** summarize lengthy financial reports, summarize customer reviews, extract key takeaways from meetings or presentations, transform data into visual graphics or chart  

## 3. Discover 
- Find new knowledge or information within data, uncover **HIDDEN** patterns, relationships, trends, or novel insights  
- **Examples of Discover:** analyze purchase history to predict future forecast, identify patterns to recommend personalized content to subscribers, search for files, identify fraudulent transactions  

## 4. Automate 
- Automate manual tasks that previously required human intervention  
- **Examples of Automate:** automate language translation in real-time text-to-speech or speech-to-text, automate documentation, automate customer feedback, and ticket creation
